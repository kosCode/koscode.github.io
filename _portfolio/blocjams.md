**Role** My student project for the [Bloc-Software Developer Track](https://www.bloc.io/software-developer-track). <br>
**Year** 2016<br><br>
**Overview**<br>
Bloc Jams is a an HTML based music player that I built as part of my course work at Bloc. The first build of Bloc Jams was in Javascript and jQuery. It was eventually refactored in Angular as a way to become familiar with the Angular framework and syntax. The goal was to create a landing page with the feel of products like spotify. Although in a much simpler form.<br><br> 
In addition, Bloc Jams is able to display albums and information about the albums. Information such as album covers, artist, record label, and details about the songs contained in the albums are displayed. There is also a component to play, seek and control the volume of individual tracks. <br><br> 
**Project**<br>
The project was built by myself with the aid of the Bloc curriculum, and my Bloc mentor to help answer questions and explain new concepts. I finished this project ahead of schedule and met all of the requirements of the project. It provided an excellent introduction to jQuery and Angular. In addition, it provided more experience with Javascript as well as troubleshooting and working my way through the inevitable challenges of coding on a project.<br><br>
