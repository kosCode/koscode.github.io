**Role** Product Manager \ Designer <br>
**Year** 2013<br><br>
**Overview**<br>
Stakz brings everything you love into one persistent location that can be shared anonymously with people who share the same interests. The content in Stakz is generated by a simply search query on any subject. Stakz searches the web for all of the articles, video, and images related to your interests.<br><br>
The typical approach to topics of interest is to put the person first, and to build communities around those topics of interest. We believed that there was also a desire to consume great content with out the need to join a social group. <br><br>
The Stakz allows you to keep track of your interests. It remembers the content that you have looked at and constantly replaces that content with new content. You can curate that content by voting it up or down. You can participate in other groups that people have created. The more you participate in curating or adding content, that the group likes, the more sway your votes have over the top rated content.<br><br>
In addition, you can start in discussions on any particular item of interest. The community also has the power to curate the comments as well. If too many people, that are interested in the group, deem the comments on the subject matter inappropriate, they have the ability to remove the comments from the group.<br><br>
**Project**<br>
This project was built out as an internal proof of concept. The project team was myself and a software engineer. One of the major goals of the project was to test several Microsoft technologies that were being offered at the time. Silverlight and the Bing API being the primary tech we were looking at. The purpose of the project was to create a functioning prototype, and to publish it to the web for a small group of testers. The project was completed in about six weeks, and achieved all of the initial goals that were set out for it. The project was parked upon completion to redirect resources on to higher priority projects.
