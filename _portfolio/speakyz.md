**Overview**<br>
Speakyz is an attempt to re imagine lecturing. The typical lecture is conducted by one person, and occasionally a few people get to ask a couple of questions. Speakyz allows everyone to participate in a lecture via their phones, tablets, and desktops in a non disruptive way. Attendees are able to text their questions and discussion points while a lecture is occurring. There are tools to moderate inappropriate comments. Speakyz also allows for a robust discussion to occur between attendees. <br><br> 
**Project**<br>
The project was initially designed as a multi platform solution. Conducting and moderating of a lecture was typically done on a desktop platform. Participating as an attendee could be from nearly any platform. The proof of concept was tested with various Microsoft technologies, and it was published to the Microsoft app store so that an alpha test could be completed. The project team consisted of myself and three engineers.<br><br>
**Results**<br>
The purpose of the initial trials was to test functionality, "in the wild", and to collect some initial anecdotal feed back from our test groups. The initial groups were a small church youth conference, and a high school honors class. 
<br><br>
The general feedback from the church group was extremely positive. The attendees really liked that they could use their phones to participate. There was far greater engagement than normal according to the leaders of the conference. There were a few issues with moderation. There were conversations that were occurring that were off topic. One of the big take aways was that there needed to be more robust moderating tools. <br><br>
The second test was done in an honors history class at a local high school. We were able to build some basic moderating tools for this test. The solution was received very well. The teacher was especially pleased woith the participation of students that did not feel comfortable speaking in class. There was one student in particular that had not spoken in class all year that was participating in discussions and actually helping to answer questions that other students had.<br><br>
The testing accomplished all of the goals set out for the initial test. We published a functioning product to the Microsoft app store. The product showed promise with our small test group. The project is currently parked on the app store awaiting funding to move forward with adding more features and conducting more robust testing.
