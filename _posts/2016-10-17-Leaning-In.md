Once I had made the decision to enroll in Bloc, I made the decision that I wanted to really immerse myself in the experience. I am a father of four. Fortunately my youngest is a Junior in high school so my kids do not require the supervision or attention that they once did. There is always something going on at my house. I really worked hard to eliminate distractions. 

I start my day with coding, and I am usually coding 2am to 3am in the morning most nights. I don't take many days off. Out of the first 5 weeks of the course, I have only skipped one day completely, but I did think about how to solve one of my more complex problems. I have coded through a hurricane, I have worked around broken appliances, and doing car repairs in my drive way, and all of the multitude of distractions that normal life can throw at you.

The biggest challenge is how to work efficiently. i wish I could say that I can sit in front of my computer and code non stop for hours on end every day. That is not the case. I really try to code as efficiently as I can. I try not to spend too long staring at the screen going no where. When I am tired I rest. I can not code well exhausted. If I was an expert maybe I could, but I am not there yet. I get up frequently to walk, pace, exercise to keep fatigue to a minimum. I really try not to get answers to questions, but understand the answers I get by repeating them in my own words back to my mentor. It takes a bit more time, but yields better results for me.

I am not saying that this is the magic recipe for everyone, but this has been working for me.
