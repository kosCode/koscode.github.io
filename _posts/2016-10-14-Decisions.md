I have spent my career as what most people would call a Product Manager. Although that was not the name of the role I was in. My road to becoming an engineer has definitely been the road less taken.

In late 2001, I was a computer analyst for the Walt Disney company. Walt Disney was in the middle of a massive migration to SAP, and part of my job was to ensure that the legacy systems were supported until the migration to SAP was complete. It was nearly a five your project from beginning to ending. At the time, it was the largest SAP implementation in the world. We had over 300,000 employess that we were trying to migrate over as well as all of the financials around our operations.

As the project began to wrap up it was apparant that the way we had implemented SAP would leave gaps in our operations. One of the early examples was a payroll adjustment spreadsheet that 20 people were trying to use simultaneously. Obviously it did not work. We did not have an application development group at the time.

That didn't stop myself and another developer that worked on my team. We took a couple of weeks to build a web app on a SQL server, and launch it to our customers. It was a huge hit. It was the beginning of buiilding over 40 apps for the team. I was eventually promoted to a Senior Manager. I had 14 engineers on my team. Over the course of the next 13 years we were able to accumulate over $100 million dollars in savings and cost avoidance for the Shared Servvices group that our team supported.

During this time I founded a very small game company, and eventually left Disney to found a very small software services company.

During that time, the teams I had worked on always had enough engineering talent. I always filled in gaps as a designer, artist, game designer, manager, etc. After doing that for years I found myself with a vrey unusual resume and body of work. My skillset was not a clean fit in any role really, but I had a wealth of experience from doing so many different things over the years.

I spent some time doing some soul searching. I came to the conclusion that I really enjoyed the process of building useful things. The tip of that spear are the engineers. I had always enjoyed coding when ever I had the opportunity, but never had the time to really dig in on it. I decided that the second phase was going to be a deep dive on coding, and use the wealth of experience I have in other areas to make me a more well rounded engineer.

So I took the leap and enrolled in the [Bloc-Software Developer program](https://www.bloc.io/software-developer-track)
