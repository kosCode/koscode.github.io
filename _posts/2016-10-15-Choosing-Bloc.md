title: Choosing

After 13 years of leading a software development team, and a couple of years of running my own company, I found myself struggling to find my next position. I had interviewed with Google, Amazon, Facebook, and a bunch of smaller companies. It became obvious to me that if I wanted to make myself more attractive to employers, I would need to get some engineering experience. There was also a part of me that wanted to take a deeper dive into software engineering. I had dabbled from time to time over various professional and personal projects, but I had never spent the time to do that as my sole focus.

It took me a while to accept the conclusion that I needed to improve my education in order to do a job that I had done successfully for the last 13 years. Once I had accepted that conclusion, I was unsure where to go to get effective training? I was very concerned about how much value I would get for my investment in my education. 

A traditional four year degree seemed extremely time consuming and expensive. I did not have the financial means to support my family for four years while I went to school. I considered learning on my own, but concluded that would do little to improve my situation. I looked into a few Boot Camps. There definitely seemed to be some solid options. Unfortunately, what I had available to me in Orlando Florida left me a little concerned. I did not want to get myself involved in a potentially predatory situation where I would dump time and effort into this endeavor with out landing a good job upon completion.

I had a good friend send me a link about Bloc. His company was using Bloc to train some of their staff. The three things I like about the program are that it is online, there is a mentor that is personally responsible for my success in the program, and the money back guarantee if the education doesn't land me a job with in 120 days of completion. Bloc's approach really appealed to the way I like to learn. 

I made the financial arrangements to enroll in the program, and I haven't looked back since.
